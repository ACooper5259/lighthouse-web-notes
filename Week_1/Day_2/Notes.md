# Day 2 Notes

## Functions

Naming:
* avoid generic names like 'data', or 'run'
* name your functions beginning with action words like createUser, or sendUserData
* be consistent with your naming conventions
* if you're joining an existing project, observe and adapt any existing conventions

A JavaScript Specific Naming Convention: use camelCase

Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
